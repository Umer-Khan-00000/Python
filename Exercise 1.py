# If you put a number in double-qoutes ("16") it will give you the output side-by-side.

# for e.g :
# a = "3"
# b ="4"
# print(a + b)

# The output will be 34 in the console. 

# but if you don't put it in double-qoutes you will get 7 in the console.

# Explicit Typing :

a = 3
b = 4
print(a + b)

# You could convert a str into int
# for e.g :

a = "78"
b = "90"

print (int(a) + int(b))

# Implicit Typecasting :
# This e.g is of a float function
c = 1.9
